# About my projects

### What are these projects?

These are projects that I have done in my school. I study in Helsinki, Finland so these projects are in Finnish. 
But every project contains README file where I explain what those projects are. There might be few mistakes here and there and code can be weird/complicated but don't let it bother :)
I have enjoyed doing these projects and I am eager to learn how to code better and smarter.
